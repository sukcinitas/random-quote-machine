# Random Quote Machine
An application I have built a while ago while going through [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Libraries Projects. I was eager to try React. The application showcases a random quote from 13 I have hardcoded (I had no intention to use any API).

Since then I have made some changes - rewritten CSS in Sass (for practice), added functionality of selecting another quote on a right arrow key press. I have decided to set up React development environment with Webpack, Babel (for practice as well).
