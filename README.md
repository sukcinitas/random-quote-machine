# Random Quote Machine

An app I've built several months ago on *Codepen* (https://codepen.io/pieno_usas/full/GzrVzN), while going through *FCC* Frontend Libraries Projects. I was eager to try React. 

Since then I've made some changes - rewritten **CSS** in **SCSS** (for practise), made little tweaks to style, DRY'ed out code. I've decided to set React development environment with Webpack instead of using *create-react-app*.

App showcases a random quote from 13 I've hardcoded (at that time wasn't intending to use any API). Quote can be tweeted, tweet field is prefilled with text automatically.
