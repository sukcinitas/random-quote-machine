# Random Quote Machine
An application I have built a while ago while going through *FCC* Front End Libraries Projects. I was eager to try React. App showcases a random quote from 13 I've hardcoded (no intention to use any API).

Since then I have made some changes - rewritten CSS in Sass (for practise), added functionality of selecting another quote on right arrow key press. I've decided to set up React development environment with Webpack, Babel (for practise as well).

## Technologies

- Sass (SCSS syntax)
- Webpack
- Babel

## Functionalities
- Get a random quote in a random background (out of 7) on button click or right arrow key press
- Tweet a quote, tweet box is prefilled with a quote.
