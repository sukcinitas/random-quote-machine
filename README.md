# Random Quote Machine

An app I've built several months ago on *Codepen* (older version: https://codepen.io/pieno_usas/full/GzrVzN, improved version: https://codepen.io/pieno_usas/full/XWrzpwX), while going through *FCC* Front End Libraries Projects. I was eager to try **ReactJS**. 

Since then I've made some changes - rewritten **CSS** in **SCSS** (for practise), made little tweaks to style, DRY'ed out code, added functionality of selecting another quote on right arrow key press. I've decided to set up **ReactJS** development environment with *Webpack, Babel* instead of using *create-react-app*(for practise as well).

App showcases a random quote from 13 I've hardcoded (at that time wasn't intending to use any API). Another one is shown on button click or right arrow key press. Quote can be tweeted, tweet field is prefilled with text automatically.
